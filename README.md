# Portfolio Manager
Simple desktop application created with Java

# About the Project
I developed this application upon completing University of Helsinki Java Programming I and II online course. I aimed for applying 
the theorical knowledge I gained from the course to a hands-on project where I could reinforce the course material and showcase my skills.

This application is a portfolio manager where user's assets are stored in a list and distribution of them is displayed as a pie chart. 
User can add/update/delete instruments to his/her portfolio and pie chart updates with each change.
